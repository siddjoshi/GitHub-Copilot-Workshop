## 🔧 Troubleshooting Agent Mode

### Common Issues and Solutions

```yaml
agent_mode_troubleshooting:
  context_limitations:
    issue: "Agent loses context in large codebases"
    solution: "Use Working Sets to focus context"
    example: "Break large projects into logical Working Sets"

  dependency_conflicts:
    issue: "Agent creates conflicting dependencies"
    solution: "Specify exact version requirements"
    example: "Include package.json or requirements.txt constraints"

  incomplete_implementations:
    issue: "Agent stops before completing all tasks"
    solution: "Use more specific task breakdown"
    example: "Number tasks and request confirmation"

  quality_variations:
    issue: "Inconsistent code quality across files"
    solution: "Use Custom Instructions for standards"
    example: "Define coding standards in project configuration"

  integration_issues:
    issue: "Services don't integrate properly"
    solution: "Specify API contracts explicitly"
    example: "Include OpenAPI specifications"
```

### Debugging Agent Responses

```bash
# Check Agent Mode configuration
cat .vscode/settings.json | grep copilot
