## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Technical Issues

#### Server Won't Start
```bash
# Check port availability
lsof -i :3000
# Kill if needed
pkill -f "node src/server.js"
# Restart
npm start
```

#### NPM Install Failures
```bash
# Clear cache
npm cache clean --force
# Delete node_modules
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
# Reinstall
npm install
```

#### ESLint Errors
- **Expected:** Console warnings are acceptable in development
- **Unexpected:** Syntax errors should be addressed immediately
- **Solution:** Run `npm run lint` to see specific issues

#### Copilot Not Responding
- Check internet connection
- Verify GitHub Copilot subscription status
- Try restarting VS Code
- Use manual examples as fallback

### Time Management Tips

#### Running Behind Schedule
- **Phase 1:** Skip detailed issue descriptions, focus on workflow
- **Phase 2:** Use pre-implemented code examples if needed
- **Phase 3:** Show rather than implement complex CI/CD

#### Ahead of Schedule
- **Deep dive:** Explore advanced Copilot features
- **Bonus challenges:** Implement additional payment methods
- **Discussion:** Share real-world AI development experiences

## Quality Checkpoints

### Mid-Session Check (40 minutes in)
- [ ] All participants completed Phase 1 successfully
- [ ] Server is running for all participants
- [ ] Basic tests are passing
- [ ] No major technical blockers

### Final Validation
- [ ] Run validation script: `bash validate-session-1.sh`
- [ ] Verify all core endpoints responding
- [ ] Confirm test suite execution
- [ ] Check that TODO comments are being addressed

## Post-Session Actions

### Immediate (within 5 minutes)
- [ ] Collect participant feedback
- [ ] Note any technical issues encountered
- [ ] Save any custom solutions developed
- [ ] Prepare session summary for next facilitator

### Follow-up (within 24 hours)
- [ ] Send participants session materials and links
- [ ] Document lessons learned
- [ ] Update materials based on feedback
- [ ] Prepare improvements for next session

## Emergency Contacts & Resources

### Technical Support
- **Repository Issues:** [Create issue in workshop repository]
- **Copilot Support:** GitHub Copilot documentation

**Facilitator Notes:**
- Stay flexible with timing - AI responses can vary
- Encourage experimentation with different Copilot prompts
- Use participant questions as learning opportunities
- Remember: goal is learning, not perfect code implementation
