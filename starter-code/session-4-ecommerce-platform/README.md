## 🤖 Agent Mode Implementation Strategy

This project is designed to showcase the advanced capabilities of GitHub Copilot Agent Mode:

### 1. Autonomous Planning Phase
- Agent analyzes the existing codebase structure
- Creates comprehensive implementation plan
- Identifies all files requiring modification
- Plans database migrations and API contracts

### 2. Multi-Service Development
- Simultaneous development across multiple programming languages
- Coordinated changes across frontend and backend
- Database schema updates with migration scripts
- API contract management and versioning

### 3. Integration and Testing
- Comprehensive test suite generation
- Performance benchmarking implementation
- Security validation and compliance checks
- Documentation generation and updates

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### Backend Services
- **Node.js/TypeScript**: Behavior analytics service
- **Python/FastAPI**: ML recommendation engine
- **Java/Spring Boot**: Dynamic pricing service
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database
- **Redis**: Caching and session storage
- **RabbitMQ**: Message queue for async processing

### Frontend Applications
- **React 18**: Customer web application
- **Next.js**: Server-side rendering and routing
- **TypeScript**: Type safety across all frontend code
- **Styled Components**: Component styling
- **React Query**: State management and API integration

### Infrastructure
- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration
